The optimality conditions derived in the previous section is a set of coupled non-linear equations with respect to the variables $\mu^{*},\nu^*,\rho^*,\phi^*,q^*$. In order to solve these we propose a numeric forward-backward algorithm. Firstly, note that if $\rho^*,\phi^*,q^*$ are known, $\mu^{*},\nu^*$ can be solved forwards in time. 

We refer the reader to \cite{takashi17} for more details on convergence results of the algorithm.
