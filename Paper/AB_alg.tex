The optimality conditions derived in the previous section is a set of coupled non-linear equations with respect to the variables $\mu^{*},\nu^*,\rho^*,\phi^*,q^*$. In order to solve these we propose a numeric forward-backward algorithm. Firstly, note that if $\rho^*,\phi^*,q^*$ are known, $\mu^{*},\nu^*$ can be solved forwards in time. Similarly, if $\mu^{*},\nu^*$ are known then the others can be solved backwards in time. 

To solve this, we do the following. First we make a guess for each of the variables. We then solve the forward-time equations for $\mu^{*},\nu^*$. We use these values to then solve for $\rho^*,\phi^*,q^*$ backwards in time. This process is repeated until convergence. 

\paragraph*{Remark} We note that the problem formulation and derived equations are infinite-history, \ie they depend on the state and control actions from $t=0$ to $t=T$. In order to make this computationally tractable to solve, we impose a $(m,n)$-finite-memory restriction. Given an $(m,n)$ input, at time $t$, we consider policies $q_t^*(u_t|x^t_{t-m},u^{t-1}_{t-n})$. 

This is a modified version of the Arimoto-Blahut algorithm proposed in \cite{Naiss13}. We refer the reader to \cite{takashi17} for more details on the convergence results of the algorithm.
