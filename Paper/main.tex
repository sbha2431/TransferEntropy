\begin{abstract}
We consider Markov decision processes (MDPs) in which the information cost quantified by transfer entropy is added to an objective specified in linear temporal logic (LTL). We assign a cost to transferring information on some of the state variables, e.g, states that are expensive to measure. We then find the policy that acts to minimize the weighted sum of the information cost and the cost of failing to satisfy the specification. We proide a method to synthesize a policy that minimizes the weighted sum of the information cost and the probability of failure to satisfy the LTL specification. We solve the problem by deriving sufficient conditions for optimality, and compute the optimal policy using a modified Arimoto-Blahut algorithm. Finally, we present a numerical experiment involving navigation and path planning and demonstrate the effect of adding information cost to certain state variables.

\section{Preliminaries}
The sequence $\left(x_1,x_{2}...x_t \right)$ is denoted $x^t$ and the subsequence $\left(x_k,x_{k+1}...x_l \right)$ is denoted by $x_{l}^{k}$. We use upper-case letters to denote random variables and lower-case letters for the realizations of the corresponding random variable. \\
We denote by $\dist{\mathcal{X}}$ the set of all probability distributions on a finite
set $\mathcal{X}$, \ie all functions $f: \mathcal{X} \to [0,1]$ such that $\sum_{x\in \mathcal{X}}f(x)=1$. %For $f\in \dist{\mathcal{X}}$ we denote by $\supp(f)$ the \emph{support} of $f$. That is, the set $\{x\in X \st f(x)>0\}$.

\section{Conclusion and future work}
In this paper, we presented a  formal way to integrate co-safe LTL constraints into a minimal-information MDP problem. We aim to relax the co-safe requirement to look at more general classes of LTL formulas by looking at the mean information cost over an infinite run. Furthermore,We aim to extend this work to a multiple coordinating agent formulation as this problem setting naturally lends itself to minimizing communication between agents who are trying to satisfy a joint specification.
