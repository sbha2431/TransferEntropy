\begin{abstract}
We consider Markov decision processes (MDPs) with an information cost quantified by transfer entropy and task specification expressed in co-safe linear temporal logic (LTL). We assume that certain state variables are expensive to measure, and quantify the information flow from those state variables to the control action with transfer entropy. We show that the transfer entropy lower bounds the amount of data in bits transferred from the specified state variables to the controller. We then provide a method to synthesize a policy that minimizes the weighted sum of the information cost and the probability of failure to satisfy the LTL specification. We solve the problem by deriving sufficient conditions for optimality, and compute the optimal policy using a modified Arimoto-Blahut algorithm. Finally, we present a numerical case study involving navigation and path planning and demonstrate the effect on decision-making of adding information cost to certain state variables.

\section{Preliminaries}
The sequence $(x_0,x_{1}...x_t)$ is denoted $x^t$ and the subsequence $x_l,x_{k+1}...x_k$ is denoted by $x_{l}^{k}$. We use upper-case letters to denote random variables and lower-case letters for the realizations of the corresponding random variable. \\
We denote by $\dist{\mathcal{X}}$ the set of all probability distributions on a finite
set $\mathcal{X}$, \ie all functions $f: \mathcal{X} \to [0,1]$ such that $\sum_{x\in \mathcal{X}}f(x)=1$. Finally, for a set $\mathcal{S}$, we define $2^\mathcal{S}$ as the set of all subsets of $\mathcal{S}$ and $S^{\omega}$ as the set of all infinite sequences of elements in $\mathcal{S}$

\section{Conclusion and future work}
In this paper, we presented a formal way to integrate co-safe LTL constraints into a minimal-information MDP problem. This is the first step in analyzing temporal logic constraints in communication constrained problems. For future work, we aim to relax the co-safe requirement to allow more general classes of LTL formulas by analyzing the mean information cost over an infinite run. Furthermore, we aim to extend this work to a multiple coordinating agent formulation as this problem setting naturally lends itself to minimizing communication between agents who are trying to satisfy a joint specification.
