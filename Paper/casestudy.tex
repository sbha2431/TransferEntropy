We demonstrate the use of information-constrained control of MDPs under temporal logic specifications in a scenario based on the upcoming Mars 2020 mission~\cite{landau2015helicopter}. 

Mars rovers operate in mostly unknown environments. Limited a priori knowledge of the terrain and possible obstacles can be provided from satellite imagery. This information, however, is often not enough for decision-making as was evidenced by the Curiosity rover which suffered punctures due to the unexpected presence of jagged, immobile, rocks embedded in the terrain. Proposed methods to reduce damage such as driving the rover backwards requires heavy human intervention and planning. For autonomous decision-making to be viable, information on local terrain characteristics is needed for planning so a human does not need to manually avoid obstacles. For the Mars 2020 mission, a helicopter has been proposed to act as a scout \cite{landau2015helicopter} to assist with planning. Figure \ref{fig:mars2020} shows an artists' rendering of the helicopter flying ahead to scout. The helicopter can then transmit information of the terrain back to the rover which is used for path planning.

We model a scenario where the rover is tasked with collecting samples from a specific region. The environment is modeled as an MDP as motion can be stochastic, i.e, slippage can occur. The mission is specified in LTL as it allows us to easily and formally state high level tasks for the rover, and the decision-making goal is to \emph{maximize} the probability of satisfying the mission specification. The helicopter can send terrain information (such as locations of any small rocks) to the rover to assist in path planning but transmitting information costs power. We provide a method that allows the planner to maximize the probability of completing the mission while also penalizing information transfer. This means the rover must plan to satisfy the mission specification while relying on as little information from the helicopter as possible. The specifics of the experiment is described in section $\ref{sec:exp}$.
